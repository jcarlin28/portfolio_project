<div class="col-sm-6"><h3>Digital Initiative</h3>To help independent cinemas make the most of their social media and digital activity, Celluloid Junkie has teamed with movie marketing company Screen Moguls on a digital initiative designed to educate and support cinemas with their digital activity during the coronavirus shutdown.
Facebook and Instagram are a vital part of any digital marketing campaign, but it can often be overwhelming to make the most of them as platforms and take advantage of opportunities when managing a page or running paid advertising.
The ability to optimise Facebook and Instagram is particularly important as cinemas start to think about reopening following coronavirus-related closures, so the first session of the Digital Initiative focused on Social Media Content Creation (specifically focusing on Facebook and Instagram), with a presentation from Sarah Knowles and Jo Fox from social, creative and PR agency Substance Global. With clients including Disney and Paramount, Substance Global is well-placed to share knowledge on social campaigns within the film industry.</div>
